## Weather Dashboard

LIVE PAGE

### Assignment

This application is a simple 5 day outlook and current weather for a city you choose. Simply type the city and search, the current weather is displayed along with a UV index score. Upon search and reload of the page the previous cities will remain listed with local storage. The page had been for the most part dynamically generated with click events, which starts the API calls using ajax.

### Development

With this application and my last I began using the sandbox a ton to play around in, this has been a tremendous help to try and get a process of building these applications with MVP in mind.

### The API
